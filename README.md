# ExploreUNIXwithC
  ExploreUNIXwithC is prepared to introduce a basic technique in UNIX/Linux programming. We will go through examples and practices of C programming language using some basic functions of UNIX. 

## Day#1:Basic of UNIX
  In this section we will introduce: fundermental concept of UNIX, Shell, and some easy example of Script Language.
### 1.1 What is UNIX/Linux?
  **UNIX** is an [_Operating System(OS)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system) which derive from a original AT&T Unix developed in the 1970s at the Bell Labs research center. 
##### _Wait! What is OS?_
  In a simplest word, an Operating System(OS) is a fundermental system software for running the software on the computer. For example, Windows, UNIX(Linux), macOS. OS has many functions in a computer system, but here, we give a brief review on:  _program execution_, _block_, _preemptive multitask_, _system call_. 
1. Program execution

      We start with CPU. [Central Processing Unit(CPU)](https://g.co/kgs/SCsae3) fetches, decodes and executes       an instruction from program memory(instruction's address is determined by [Program Counter(PC)](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Microprocessor_Design/Program_Counter)). OS itself is also a           program([kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system))). During OS execution, PC determines kernel.         To execute a new program (here we call a.out), a.out is copied from file to memory, then modify the PC to point to             a.out. The CPU will now execute a.out. In a case of only one CPU is used, during a.out program's execution, kernel             cannot be executed. Here, timer [interrupt](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Operating_System_Design/Processes/Interrupt)         is used to make it possible to return after a.out program is executed.

2. Block

      To temporarily suspend the execution of the program is called **block**. Let's see an example.
      
      ```
      % sleep 5; echo goodmorning
      ```
      
      Executing this command, after about 5 seconds, _goodmorning_ will be printed on the screen. It means, execution is blocked for 5 seconds. However, during that 5 seconds, what was CPU doing? The answer is "CPU was wexecuting another program".
      Meaning, when a [process](https://g.co/kgs/Ea4Efj) is blocked, OS make a [process switching](https://www.streetdirectory.com/travel_guide/137699/computers/process_switching.html) to execute another process.
      
3. Preemptive Multitask

      Recent OS(including UNIX) has **preemptive multitask** function. Preemptive multitasking is an execution method that makes it appear that multiple programs are running at the same time. In preemptive multitasking, the OS uses the timer interrupt function of the CPU to switch processes anywhere in the program execution without blocking. 
      
4. System Call

      A [system call](https://g.co/kgs/JmKw8D) is used to interact with the kernel. (It is different between system call and library function.)
